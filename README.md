# 🏗️ Financial Intelligence Platform: From ETL to AI
🎯 Project Goal: The "Full Stack" Journey
This repository documents my journey moving beyond simple data analysis to build a scalable, end-to-end data platform.

My goal is to evolve a standard Fraud Detection Dashboard into a production-grade Financial Intelligence System. I am using this project to master the complete data lifecycle:

Data Engineering: Building robust Bronze/Silver/Gold ETL pipelines.

Analytics Engineering: Designing Star Schemas and semantic models.

AI & LLMs: Implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for automated compliance reporting.
